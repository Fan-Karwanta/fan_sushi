#Fan's Sushi
#Deployed a Responsive Website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In this project, I learned to:
- Use CSS variables
- Import CSS files into other CSS files
- Use flex and position properties in CSS
- Create smooth and subtle animations
- Use the BEM naming method
- Maintain a well-organized file and folder structure
-  Embrace the principles of writing clean code.
